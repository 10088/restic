Change: Remove `--drive-use-trash=false` from default rclone params

By default restic used launched rclone with --drive-use-trash=false,
since google drive trash retention policy changed, it is no longer required.
Rclone will now use what's provided in by the `--drive-use-trash
parameter, `drive-use-trash` config or RCLONE_CONFIG_*_USE_TRASH env
falling back to `true` as a default (as of: v1.53.2).
