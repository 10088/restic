Enhancement: Cancel commands if lock is not refresh in time

Restic commands kept running even if they failed to refresh their locks in
time. This can be a problem if a concurrent call to `unlock` and `prune`
removes data from the repository. Not refreshing a lock in time can for example
be caused by a client switching to standby while running a backup.

Lock handling is now much stricter. Commands requiring a lock are canceled if
the lock is not refreshed successfully in time.
