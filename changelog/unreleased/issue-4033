Change: copy command no longer prints skipped existing snapshots by default

# Describe the problem in the past tense, the new behavior in the present
# tense. Mention the affected commands, backends, operating systems, etc.
# Focus on user-facing behavior, not the implementation.

Restic copy always printed each skipped snapshot that existed on the remote and
would bury the snapshots that were copied amongst the output.  The new default
only outputs new copies.  Increase the verbose level to see skipped existing
snapshots.
