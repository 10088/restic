Enhancement: Allow backup file tree scanner to be disabled

Restic walks the file tree in a separate scanner process to find the total size
and file/directory count, and uses that to provide an ETA.  This can slow down
backups, especially of network filesystems.  The new flag `--no-scan`
can be used to speed up such backups.
